Hi there.
Morse Code Converter is an interesting and trouble-free python project which helps the user to convert any text or words or letters to a morse code and vice-versa.
This is an easy project to try if you are learning basics in python.
I have given a very easy way of conversion. Use the code by downloading it and run in either VS code or Jupyter Notebook or even in Google Colab.
If you even need any further assistance in this thing you can ping me through my email.
